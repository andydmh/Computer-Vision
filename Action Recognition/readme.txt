This project is still under development.

Objective: Recognize actions from videos using machine learning classifiers and suitable features.
Current Classifiers: SVM and Neural Networks (using already engineer features).
Currently Working On: Implementing an architecture that uses Deep Learning (CNNs and RNNs).
